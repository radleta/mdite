# Tutorial

Step-by-step tutorial for using the application.

## Getting Started

Follow the [Setup](./setup.md) guide first.

## Using the API

Once setup is complete, you can use the API to interact with the application.

For detailed API documentation, see the [API Reference](../api/README.md).

**Note:** This is an external link pointing outside the `docs/guides/` scope. By default, mdite will validate that this file exists but won't traverse into the API documentation when running `mdite lint docs/guides/README.md`.

## Next Steps
