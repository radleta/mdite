# Connected Document

This file is connected to the documentation graph because it's linked from [README.md](./README.md).

## Graph Connectivity

Being part of the connected graph means:
- ✅ This file is reachable from the entrypoint
- ✅ Users can navigate to this file following links
- ✅ This file is not orphaned

## Why Connectivity Matters

Documentation should form a connected graph where:
- All files are discoverable from the entrypoint
- Users can navigate naturally through links
- No files are accidentally forgotten

## The Orphan in This Example

There's another file in this directory (`orphaned.md`) that is **not** linked from anywhere. This makes it an orphan - users can't reach it by following links.

## Fixing Orphans

To fix an orphaned file, you can:
1. **Link to it** from an existing file in the graph
2. **Remove it** if it's no longer needed
3. **Move it** to another location if it doesn't belong here
