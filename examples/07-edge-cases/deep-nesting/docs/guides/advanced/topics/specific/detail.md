# Detail Page

You've reached the deepest level! This is level 6 of the deep nesting. ðŸŽ‰

## Current Location

```
README â†’ docs/ â†’ guides/ â†’ advanced/ â†’ topics/ â†’ specific/ â†’ [detail.md]
                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                              Level 6 (deepest!)
```

## Path to Here

From the root README, the path is:
```
./docs/guides/advanced/topics/specific/detail.md
```

That's quite a journey!

## Relative Path Back

To get back to README from here:
```
../../../../../README.md
```

That's **5 levels up** with `../` repeated 6 times!

## Navigation

- Up: [Specific Topic Index](./index.md)
- Way Up: [Topics Index](../index.md)
- Root: [README](../../../../../README.md)

## Why This Matters

This deep nesting demonstrates:
- âœ… mdite can find files at any depth
- âœ… Relative paths resolve correctly across many levels
- âœ… Links work bidirectionally (down and up the tree)
- âœ… No performance issues with deep structures

## Return Journey

Navigate back up:
1. [Specific Topic Index](./index.md) (up 1 level)
2. [Topics Index](../index.md) (up 2 levels)
3. [Advanced Guide](../../index.md) (up 3 levels)
4. [Guides Index](../../../index.md) (up 4 levels)
5. [Docs Index](../../../../index.md) (up 5 levels)
6. [README](../../../../../README.md) (up 6 levels - back to root!)

## Content

This is the deepest file in the example. mdite should have no trouble finding and validating it!

## Quick Return

Jump straight back to [README](../../../../../README.md).
